# my-portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio, it is not completed yet because I need to fill in my filler code with things about me. This portfolio is responsive to different screensizes and it also has alt tags and pseudocode. The links work except for the resume link and all of the projects labeled "computer 1, 2, 3". There are a few bugs but they should be fixed in time before an employer see's it.
